TypeIt aims to make website image performance simple, impactful, and just as critically, _reliable_. That’s why I guarantee 99% monthly uptime for those relying on TypeIt.

### What is “uptime”?

"Uptime" refers to the period of time when TypeIt is running, which includes allowing administrative access and successfully handling image requests.

### What happens if it’s below 99%?

If I'm doing this right, we won't need to deal with this situation. But occasionally, reality hits hard. So, if uptime drops below 99%, I'll notify you and credit your subscription with a week of free service for every 30-minute interval of downtime below that mark.

### How do we track that uptime?

It's tracked by monitoring the server-side exceptions through a third-party service, as well as Cloudflare's built-in dashboard. Unfortunately, this information is currently not publicly available.

### Will this change in the future?

Rarely. If it does, I'll notify you by sending an email.

### What if I have questions about this SLA?
