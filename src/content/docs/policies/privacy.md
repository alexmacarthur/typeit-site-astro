Effective Date: July 1st, 2023.

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") outlines how TypeIt ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects personal information obtained from users ("you" or "user") of the TypeIt website and services. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the confidentiality of your personal information.

### 1. Information We Collect

a. Personal Information: When you use TypeIt, we may collect certain personal information such as your name, email address, and contact details. We collect this information when you voluntarily provide it to us during the registration or account creation process. These details are housed by a Clerk, a third-party authentication service. Use of Clerk's services is subject to Clerk's terms and conditions.

b. Usage Information: We may also collect non-personal information, including but not limited to a vistor's IP address, browser type, device information, and usage patterns. This information helps us improve our services and enhance your experience. No cookies are collected when a vistor uses a site whose images are powered by TypeIt.

### 2. Use of Information

a. Service Provision: We use the personal information provided to us to deliver and optimize the TypeIt services you have requested. This includes optimizing images, managing your account, providing customer support, and processing refunds or cancellations as per our refund and cancellation policies.

b. Communication: We may use your contact information to communicate with you regarding your account, updates, service-related announcements, and other relevant information. We may also send you promotional or marketing communications if you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable laws.

### 3. Data Storage and Sharing

a. Data Storage: The images you use with TypeIt for optimization are stored in a third-party cloud storage bucket for the sole purpose of accessing and delivering them to your website or as per your instructions. We do not claim ownership of these images.

b. Third-Party Services: We may utilize the services of third-party vendors, including cloud storage providers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), to facilitate the delivery of our services. These vendors have limited access to personal information solely for the purposes outlined in this Policy and are contractually bound to protect the confidentiality and security of your information.

### 4. Data Retention

a. Optimized Images: Optimized images that have been stored in the cloud storage will remain available, even if you suspend or cancel your TypeIt subscription. If you wish to have these images removed, you must specifically request their deletion.

b. Retention Period: We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### 5. Security Measures

a. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 6. Children's Privacy

TypeIt's services are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take prompt steps to delete the information from our systems.

### 7. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website or by other means of communication. Your continued use of TypeIt following the posting of changes signifies your acceptance of such changes.
