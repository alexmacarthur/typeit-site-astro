description: The image formats that can be optimized by TypeIt.
---

TypeIt can optimize just about any image format used on the web. Specifically, that list includes:

- JPEG
- PNG
- WebP
- GIF (animated GIFs are cool too!)
- AVIF
- TIFF
- SVG

For all of these formats, TypeIt will perform a basic optimization on the original format, and then attempt to reformat & optimize it to a modern format. No matter what, you'll get a faster image at the other end of the request (unless an optimization has already occurred before TypeIt got a hold of it).
