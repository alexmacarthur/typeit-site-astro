Once you've got an account set up and have set your domain, you're ready to use TypeIt.

## Tweak Your Image URLs

TypeIt wraps around your current image URLs and takes it from there. You just need to prefix your current URLs with `https://TypeIt.dev/`. For example:

**Before:** `https://some-site.com/img.jpg`

**After:** `https://TypeIt.dev/https://some-site.com/img.jpg`

That's it. When requests start coming through to those images, you'll start getting the optimized, cached version. [See here](/docs/expectations) to learn more about what to expect.

By the way: if you're on WordPress, this process is even simpler. Installing the [TypeIt WordPress plugin](/docs/wordpress/) will automatically transform most of your URLs for you. Unless you're handling custom images somewhere in your theme, you won't even need to touch any code.
